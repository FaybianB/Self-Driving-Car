# Self-Driving Car
![Self-Driving Car](media/SelfDrivingCar.gif)

This is a self-driving car simulation implemented using pure Javascript.

## Features
- The simulation features a neural network that controls the car's movements.
- The car is equipped with sensors to detect its surroundings and uses a brain, modeled as a neural network, to make decisions based on the sensor data.
- The car's brain can be saved and loaded from local storage, allowing for continuous learning across multiple sessions.
- The simulation also includes a road with multiple lanes and dummy traffic to create a realistic driving environment.
- The car's performance can be visualized in real-time on a separate canvas.
- The simulation is designed to be flexible, supporting multiple cars and different control types.
